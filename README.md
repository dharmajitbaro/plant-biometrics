# PlantBiometrics

## Overview

This project focuses on the development of a deep learning model to detect plant leaves and recognize diseases present in them. The primary goal is to leverage the power of ResNet-50 architecture to identify the plant species and detect diseases on plant leaves.

## Models

## Plant species identification
I initially created a model using ResNet-50 in a Jupyter notebook (plant_species_identification.ipynb). This model is designed to identify the species of a plant based on its leaf characteristics.
## Disease detection
Another model was developed using ResNet-50 to detect diseases on plant leaves. The Jupyter notebook (disease_detection.ipynb) provides details on training this model.
## Integration
To create a comprehensive solution, I've combined both models in a Python file (combine_models.py). This integrated model successfully identifies plant species and detects diseases, achieving an overall accuracy of 89%.

# How to use




## Deployment

1.Clone the repository to your local maschine

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/dharmajitbaro/plant-biometrics.git

```
2.navigate to the project directory
```bash
  cd plant-biometrics

```

3.Follow the instructions in the respective Jupyter notebooks and Python file to train the models and utilize the integrated solution.
